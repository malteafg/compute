# Compute (WIP)

This repository provides examples for using compute shaders to execute code on GPU's. There are
examples written in various programming languages using several different GPU API's and frameworks.

## Supported programming languages and GPU API's/frameworks
* Python
    * Kompute
    * CUDA
* C++
    * Kompute
* Rust
    * wgpu

## Structure
There is a folder for each programming language. Inside each programming language folder, there is a
folder for each of the GPU API's/frameworks that have examples for that language. These folders
contain a README file specifying how to install dependencies and run the examples.

## Examples
todo provide a description of each example
